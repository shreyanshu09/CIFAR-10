# CIFAR-10

In this work, we present a full detailed report on image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We build our own convolutional neural network with optimized parameters and also use 10 different DCNNs. Afterward, we perform several experiments on it and compare them with each other. In addition, we also use some traditional and modern techniques in order to increase the performance accuracy of the models.
